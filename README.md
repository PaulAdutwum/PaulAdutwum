Hi there! I’m Paul Adutwum, a sophomore studying Engineering and Computer Science at Bates College. When I’m not immersed in my projects or school work, you’ll likely find me playing soccer, reading by the pond on campus, or debating ideas with friends in the dining hall over the weekend. I’m a firm believer in spaces that foster open conversation, collaboration, and equity, which I see as essential for sparking creativity, innovation, and meaningful connections. This belief drives everything I do and shapes how I approach both teamwork and learning.

I am a tech enthusiast with a unrelenting curiosity for computer science and its potential to tackle real-world challenges. I thrive in collaborative, mission-driven environments where everyone feels welcomed. I love contributing, sharing ideas, and learning from others while working on ambitious projects or just thinking outside the box. Self-motivated and always eager to learn, I’m passionate about creating and co-creating with others who share a drive for innovation and making the world better with technology.
